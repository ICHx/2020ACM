# Q2.
This is the first time I am actually coding with Python, an easy to use dynamical typed language.\

Recursion obviously has limitation on perform deep depth operation.  \
The problem is exaggerated in the adoption of Python language, being interpreted.  \
When N is large, not only it is slow, but the interpreter would use up CPU resources before failing with error output.\

Therefore, when deep depth operation is neccessary, do not use interpreted language, otherwise, avoid recursion.\
