This is the first time I am actually coding with Python, an easy to use dynamical typed language.
And it is observed that PyPy perform extraordinarily bad in recursion.

# Q1.
First time noting that Python does not use curly braces(which is a set) as array, but [] instead.
If subscript is added to {} element, it will exit saying "set is unsubscriptable".


# Q2.
Recursion obviously has limitation on perform deep depth operation.
The problem is exaggerated in the adoption of Python language, being interpreted.
When N is large, not only it is slow, but the interpreter would use up CPU resources before failing with error output.

Therefore, when deep depth operation is necessary, do not use interpreted language, otherwise, avoid recursion.

# Q3.
Slight different, has to change the polarity switch one step earlier.

# Q4.
